The path of a satellite revolving around the earth is known as orbit. Orbital Mechanics is the science that helps us understand how a satellite moves when it is in orbit.

### Orbital Elements

Orbital elements are parameters that uniquely define the orbital motion of a satellite. Following are the commonly used orbital elements:
* Semi major axis
* Eccentricity
* Mean anomaly
* Argument of perigee
* Inclination
* Longitude of Ascending node

We can easily distinguish between two satellites using their orbital elements. 

### Semi Major Axis
