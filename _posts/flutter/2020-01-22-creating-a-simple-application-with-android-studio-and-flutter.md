Here we will create a simple application using Flutter and Android Studio. The link to the source code repo is at the bottom of this page. 

Following are the required steps:

**Step 1.** Open Android Studio.

**Step 2.** To create Flutter Project click **File** -> **New** -> **New Flutter Project**

**Step 4.** Configure the application as below and click **Next**:
* Project name: **simple_flutter_app**
* Flutter SDK Path: **path_to_flutter_sdk**
* Project Location: **path_to_project_folder**
* Description: **A simple application using Flutter and Android Studio**

**Step 5.** Set the company domain as **example.com** and click **Finish**.

Now you have a fully working flutter application open in Android Studio. Now we will modify the code to create our application.

Now lets explore the structure of the application:
<img src="/assets/images/flutter_3.png">

Following is description of some of the files listed in above image:
* **android** − Auto generated source code to create android application
* **ios** − Auto generated source code to create ios application
* **lib** − Main folder containing Dart code written using flutter framework
* **lib/main.dart** − Entry point of the Flutter application. In this application we will modify this file only.
* **test** − Folder containing Dart code to test the flutter application
* **test/widget_test.dart** − Basic Flutter widget test sample code
* **.gitignore** − Git version control file. Tells git to ignore the listed files.
* **.metadata** − Auto generated by the flutter tools. Tracks properties of this Flutter project.
* **.packages** − Auto generated to track the flutter packages.
* **pubspec.lock** − Auto generated by the Flutter package manager.
* **pubspec.yaml** − Used by Flutter package manager
* **README.md** − Project description file written in Markdown format
* **simple_flutter_app.iml** − project file used by Android studio

**Step 6.** Now we have to replace the dart code in **lib/main.dart** with the following code:
{% highlight dart %}
{% raw %}

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Simple Application',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.red,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Title Page'),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  MyHomePage({Key key, this.title}) : super(key: key);
  final String title;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text(this.title),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child:
          Text(
            'Hello World',
          )
      ),
    );
  }
}

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

**Step 7.** Now run the app using **Run** -> **Run main.dart**
<p class="text-center">

</p>

**Step 8.** Now you can see the app running:
