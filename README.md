# A reminder
emroline.com is nothing right now. Until it becomes "SOMETHING" it will be nothing. I am uploading tutorials for now and i am planning to turn this site into an asset. A useful science and technology site.

# Code Of Conduct
* Never change a post's filename once it is defined, because it will change the link.
* If you have to modify the title, change it in the post content, dont change the file name.

# How to push code to emroline.github.io
* JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build
* Replace contents of `emroline.github.io` directory with the contents of `_site` directory in `emroline.github.io dev` directory.
* push the code.


Just focus on writing lots of examples. Right now i think its wise to focus on one thing and upload contents related to that stuff only. So whats that topic on which you want to write 130 articles? Flutter and android.


In 13 days create 130+ articles on this site. Make the site complete and professional and appy for google ads once more. So that when i reach Kanpur, my site is complete and fully working and then my next work will be to invite every students i meet to contribute some articles on my site and in this way this will be the first asset i create and it will be the first product of my company.
