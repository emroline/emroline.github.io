Algorithms and Data Structures are tools that help you develop problem solving skills and coding sense. Programming languages come and go, but the core of programming, which is algorithms and data structures remains the same. These are language agnostic.

So, if you are serious about programming and realizing it now that algorithms and data structure is not optional, here are some great resources to learn about data structures.

A **data structure** is a particular way of organizing, managing and storing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.
Using following resources you can learn a lot about Data Structures.
