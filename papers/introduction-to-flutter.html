And creating beautiful User Interface is a challenge in itself. Using Flutter you can create beautiful apps for both Android and iOS in one go. once you build an application using flutter it can be deployed on Android as well as iOS.Flutter is a simple and high performance framework based on Dart language. It provides high performance by rendering the UI directly in the operating system’s canvas rather than through native framework. Flutter has many ready to use widgets, by combining them in various combinations you can design any kind of UI you desire.Features of Flutter Modern and reactive framework. Very Fast development. Stateful hot reload. Lots of ready made widgets. Natively build application. Create once and deploy on many platforms (Android, iOS, desktop, web) Use Dart programming language. Dart is very easy to learn.Advantages of Flutter Flutter is Free and Open Source. Dart language has a large repository(https://pub.dev/) of software packages, which you can use to expand the capabilities of your app. Flutter needs lesser testing. You can write single test for both Android and iOS. Flutter allows fast development. Developers need to write a single code base for both Android and iOS. You can build your apps even for desktop and web.Disadvantages of Flutter You need to learn Dart. But practically its not a disadvantage because Dart is very easy. Designing in Dart is much easier and fun."><meta name="author" content="Emroline"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:locale" content="en_US"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Emroline"><meta property="og:title" content="Introduction To Flutter"><meta property="og:url" content="https://www.emroline.com/papers/introduction-to-flutter"><meta property="og:description" content="Generally, if you have to develop a mobile application, its a complex and challenging task.
